				<h1>The fundamentals of understanding color theory</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="about1">
				<p>
					Color theory is both the science and art of using color. It explains how humans perceive color; and the
					visual effects of how colors mix, match or contrast with each other. Color theory also involves the
					messages colors communicate; and the methods used to replicate color.
				</p>
				<p>
					In color theory, colors are organized on a color wheel and grouped into 3 categories: primary colors,
					secondary colors and tertiary colors. More on that later.

				<p>
					So why should you care about color theory as an entrepreneur? Why can’t you just slap some red on your
					packaging and be done with it? It worked for Coke, right?
				</p>
				<p>
					Color theory will help you build your brand. And that will help you get more sales.

					<h2>
						Understanding color
					</h2>
					<p>
						Color is perception. Our eyes see something (the sky, for example), and data sent from our eyes to our
						brains tells us it’s a certain color (blue). Objects reflect light in different combinations of
						wavelengths. Our brains pick up on those wavelength combinations and translate them into the
						phenomenon we call color.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you’re strolling down the soft drink aisle scanning the shelves filled with 82 million cans and
						bottles and trying to find your six-pack of Coke, what do you look for? The scripted logo or that
						familiar red can?
					</p>
					<p>
						People decide whether or not they like a product in 90 seconds or less. 90% of that decision is based
						solely on color. So, a very important part of your branding must focus on color.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="aboutrgb__container">
					<h2 id="rgb">RGB: the additive color mixing model</h2>

					<p>
						Humans see colors in light waves. Mixing light—or the additive color mixing model—allows you to create
						colors by mixing red, green and blue light sources of various intensities. The more light you add, the
						brighter the color mix becomes. If you mix all three colors of light, you get pure, white light.
					</p>
					<div class="image">
						<img src="img/rgbimage.png" alt="rgb color mixing">
					</div>
					<p>
						TVs, screens and projectors use red, green and blue (RGB) as their primary colors, and then mix them
						together to create other colors.
					</p>
					<span>Why should you care?</span>
					<div>
						Let’s say you have a very distinct brand with a bright yellow logo. If you post the logo on Facebook,
						Twitter or your website and don’t use the correct color process, your logo will appear muddy instead
						of
						that bright yellow. That’s why, when working with files for any screen, use RGB, not CMYK.
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="aboutcmyk__container">
					<h2 id="cmyk">CMYK: the subtractive color mixing model</h2>
					<p>
						Any color you see on a physical surface (paper, signage, packaging, etc.) uses the subtractive color
						mixing model. Most people are more familiar with this color model because it’s what we learned in
						kindergarten when mixing finger paints. In this case, “subtractive” simply refers to the fact that you
						subtract the light from the paper by adding more color.
					</p>
					<div class="image">
						<img src="img/cmykimage.png" alt="cmyk color mixing">
					</div>
					<p>
						Traditionally, the primary colors used in subtractive process were red, yellow and blue, as these were
						the colors painters mixed to get all other hues. As color printing emerged, they were subsequently
						replaced with cyan, magenta, yellow and key/black (CMYK), as this color combo enables printers to
						produce a wider variety of colors on paper.
					</p>
					<span>Why should you care?</span>
					<p>
						You’ve decided to print a full-color brochure. If you’re investing all that money into your marketing
						(printing ain’t cheap!), you expect your printer is going to get the colors right.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since printing uses the subtractive color mixing method, getting accurate color reproduction can only
						be achieved by using CMYK. Using RGB will not only result in inaccurate color, but a big bill from
						your printer when you’re forced to ask them to reprint your entire run.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="aboutcolorwheel__container">
					<h2 id="colorwheel">The color wheel</h2>
					<p>
						I don’t know about you, but when I was a kid, the best part about going back to school in the fall was
						getting that new, pristine 64-count box of Crayola crayons. The possibilities seemed endless. Until
						I’d inevitably lose the black crayon.
					</p>
					<p>
						Understanding the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn’t and how color
						communicates) is just as exciting as that new box of crayons. No really.
					</p>
					<p>
						Being able to understand the terms and processes that go along with color will help you knowledgeably
						communicate your vision with your designer, printer, or even (maybe) an Apple Store Genius.
					</p>
					<h2>Color wheel basics</h2>
					<p>
						The first color wheel was designed by Sir Isaac Newton in 1666 so it absolutely predates your
						introduction to it in kindergarten. Artists and designers still use it to develop color harmonies,
						mixing and palettes.
					</p>
					<p>
						The color wheel consists of three primary colors (red, yellow, blue), three secondary colors (colors
						created when primary colors are mixed: green, orange, purple) and six tertiary colors (colors made
						from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).
					</p>
					<p>
						Draw a line through the center of the wheel, and you’ll separate the warm colors (reds, oranges,
						yellows) from cool colors (blues, greens, purples).
					</p>
					<div class="image">
						<img src="img/warmcool.png" alt="warm cool color">
					</div>
					<p>
						Warm colors are generally associated with energy, brightness, and action, whereas cool colors are
						often identified with calm, peace, and serenity.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you recognize that color has a temperature, you can understand how choosing all warm or all cool
						colors in a logo or on your website can impact your message.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="abouthue__container">
					<h2 id="hue">Hue, shade, tint and tone</h2>
					<p>
						Let’s go back to that 64-pack of crayons from our first day of school. (Remember “raw umber”? What is
						an umber anyway, and is it actually better raw than cooked?) Anyway, you might be wondering, how we
						got from the twelve colors on our original color wheel to all those crayons? That’s where tints,
						shades, and tones come in.
					</p>
					<div class="image">
						<img src="img/hueimage.png" alt="hue shade tine and tone image">
					</div>
					<p>
						Simply put, tints, tones and shades are variations of hues, or colors, on the color wheel. A tint is a
						hue to which white has been added. For example, red + white = pink. A shade is a hue to which black
						has been added. For example, red + black = burgundy. Finally, a tone is a color to which black and
						white (or grey) have been added. This darkens the original hue while making the color appear more
						subtle and less intense.
					</p>
					<h2>Color schemes</h2>
					<p>
						Let’s talk schemes… (And not the kind that cartoon villains concoct. Bwahaha!) We’re talking color
						schemes. Using the color wheel, designers develop a color scheme for marketing materials.
					</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="aboutcomplementary__container">
					<h2 id="complementary">Complementary colors</h2>
					<p>
						Complementary colors are opposites on the color wheel—red and green, for example.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because there’s a sharp contrast between the two colors, they can really make imagery pop, but
						overusing them can get tiresome. Think any shopping mall in December. That being said, using a
						complementary color scheme in your business marketing offers sharp contrast and clear
						differentiation
						between images.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="aboutanalogous__container">
				<h2 id="analogous">Analogous colors</h2>
				<p>
					Analogous colors sit next to one another on the color wheel—red, orange and yellow, for example. When
					creating an analogous color scheme, one color will dominate, one will support and another will accent.
					In business, analogous color schemes are not only pleasing to the eye, but can effectively instruct
					the consumer where and how to take action.
				</p>
				<div class="image">
					<img src="img/analogouscolor.png" alt="analogous color image">
				</div>
				<p>
					The Tostitos website uses an analogous color scheme. Notice the bright orange navigation bar draws the
					eye to explore the site, and accent-colored links at the bottom direct hungry consumers with the
					munchies to “Buy Online.”
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="abouttriadic__container">
				<h2 id="triadic">Triadic colors</h2>
				<p>
					Triadic colors are evenly spaced around the color wheel and tend to be very bright and dynamic.
				</p>
				<p>
					Using a triadic color scheme in your marketing creates visual contrast and harmony simultaneously,
					making each item stand out while making the overall image pop.
				</p>
				<p>
					Burger King uses this color scheme quite successfully. Hey, is it lunchtime yet?
				</p>

				<h2 id="important">But really, why should you care about color theory?</h2>
				<p>
					Two words: branding and marketing.
				</p>
				<p>
					No wait, three words: branding, marketing and sales.
				</p>
				<p>
					With this basic knowledge about colors and color schemes, you’re prepared to make effective branding
					decisions. Like what color your logo should be. Or the emotions that colors evoke in a consumer and
					the psychology behind color choices on your website.
				</p>
				<p>
					Think it doesn’t matter? Take a look at this article on color combinations from hell. It just hurts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not only can knowledge of color theory guide you in your own marketing, it can also help you better
					understand what your competition is doing.
				</p>
				<p>
					In a side-by-side comparison of three law firm web pages, you’ll notice a variety of analogous color
					schemes. Blue is generally associated with dependability, brown with masculinity, and yellow with
					competence and happiness. All of these are positive associations in a field that stereotypically has
					negative connotations, such as dishonesty or aggression.
				</p>
				<p>
					Making your brand stand out and appeal to your target, plus understanding that poor colors can mean
					poor sales—that’s why you should care about color theory.
				</p>
				<p>
					Want to know more about the emotions that colors evoke, and how color psychology can help you in
					selecting the best colors for your logo?
