				<p>Every website is different, but there are many things that are essentially the same<br>from one web site
					to the next. Rather than write the same code over and over, it’s a<br>good idea to create your own
					“boilerplate”. A <mark>boilerplate</mark> is a template that you<br>break out each time you start a
					project, saving
					you from having to start from<br>scratch.</p>
				<p>
					Wikipedia describes boilerplates as:<br>sections of code that are repeated in multiple places with little
					to no variation.
				</p>
				<p>As you learn HTML5 and add new techniques to your toolbox, you’re likely going to<br>want to build
					yourself an HTML boilerplate to start off all future projects. This is<br>definitely worth doing, and
					there are many starting points online to help you build<br>your own HTML5 template.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="block">
				<h3 id="simpleExample">A Really Simple Example of a Starter HTML 5 Boilerplate</h3>
				<p>The full template that we offer at the end of this article has a lot in it. But you don’t<br>have to get
					that fancy — especially if you’re just getting started. Here’s a really<br>simple “getting started” HTML5
					template that may be all you need:<br></p>
				<img src="img/image1.png" alt="codefoto">
				<p>If you paste the code above into an <img src="img/htmlimage.png" alt="foto"> file, you’ll have a
					web page!
					This basic,<br>HTML5 template includes some of the elements listed in the next section, as well<br>as a
					simple heading element that will be displayed in your web browser.<br>Let’s look at this anatomy in more
					detail.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="block">
				<h3 id="anatomy">The Anatomy of an HTML5 Template</h3>
				<p>
					An HTML template typically includes the following parts:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The document type declaration (or doctype)</li>
					<li>The <img src="img/htmltag.png" alt="foto"> Element</li>
					<li>The character encoding</li>
					<li>The viewport meta element</li>
					<li><img src="img/titletag.png" alt="foto">,<img src="img/descriptiontag.png" alt="toto">, and <img
							src="img/authortag.png" alt="foto">
					</li>
					<li>Open Graph meta elements for social cards</li>
					<li>Favicons and touch icons</li>
					<li>Links to CSS styles</li>
					<li>Links to JavaScript files</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Other than the document type declaration and <img src="img/htmltag.png" alt="foto"> element, the
					elements<br>listed above will mostly be found inside the <img src="img/headtag.png" alt="foto"> section
					of the HTML<br>template.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="block">
				<h3 id="doctype">The HTML5 Doctype</h3>
				<p>Your HTML5 template needs to start with a document type declaration, or<br>doctype. A
					<mark>doctype</mark> is simply a
					way to tell the browser — or any other parser —<br>what type of document it’s looking at. In the case of
					HTML files, it means the<br>specific version and flavor of HTML. The doctype should always be the first
					item<br>
					at the top of any HTML file. Many years ago, the doctype declaration was an ugly<br>and hard-to-remember
					mess, often specified as “XHTML Strict” or “HTML<br>Transitional”.
				</p>
				<p>With the advent of HTML5, those indecipherable eyesores are gone and now all<br>you need is this:</p>
				<img src="img/doctypetag.png" alt="foto">
				<p>Simple, and to the point. The doctype can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or<br>mixed case. You’ll
					notice that the “5” is conspicuously missing from the<br>declaration. Although the current iteration of
					web
					markup is known as “HTML5”, it<br>really is just an evolution of previous HTML standards — and future
					specifications<br>will simply be a development of what we have today. There’s never going to be
					an<br>“HTML6”,
					so it’s common to refer to the current state of web markup as simply<br>“HTML”.
				</p>
				<p>Because browsers are required to support older content on the Web, there’s no<br>reliance on the doctype
					to
					tell browsers which features should be supported in a<br>given document. In other words, the doctype
					alone
					isn’t going to make your pages<br>compliant with modern HTML features. It’s really up to the browser to
					determine<br>feature support on a case-by-case basis, regardless of the doctype used. In fact,<br>you can
					use
					one of the older doctypes with new HTML5 elements on a page and<br>the page will render the same as it
					would
					if you used the new doctype.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="block">
				<h3 id="htmlelement">The <img src="img/htmltag.png" alt="foto"> Element</h3>
				<p>The <img src="img/htmltag.png" alt="foto"> element is the top-level element in an HTML file — meaning
					that it<br>contains everything in the document other than the doctype. The <img src="img/htmltag.png"
						alt="foto"><br>element is divided into two parts — the <img src="img/headtag.png" alt="foto"> and <img
						src="img/bodytag.png" alt="foto"> sections.<br>Everything else in the web page file will be placed
					either in the <img src="img/headtag.png" alt="foto"> element or<br>inside the <img src="img/bodytag.png"
						alt="foto"> element.
				</p>
				<p>The code below shows the <img src="img/htmltag.png" alt=""> element, which follows the
					doctype<br>declaration and includes the <img src="img/headtag.png" alt="foto"> and <img
						src="img/bodytag.png" alt="foto"> elements:<br><img src="img/image2.png" alt="foto">
				</p>

				<h3 id="finaltemplate">The Complete HTML5 Boilerplate</h3>

					Here’s our final HTML5 Template — a basic boilerplate that you can use for any<br>project:<br>

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>There are lots of HTML starter templates and frameworks available online that<br>come with ready-made CSS and
			JavaScript files and a lot of pre-written content<br>that you can play around with and modify. That wasn’t our
			aim
			here. The basic<br>boilerplate we’ve presented here includes all the things you’re likely to need
			when<br>designing any web page, so that you don’t have to start completely from scratch<br>every time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Feel free to copy the basic HTML page template we showed at the start, or
			the<br>complete one shown above, and
			use
			them in your projects. Over time, you’ll<br>probably find that there are bits you don’t often need, and other
			things we didn’t<br>mention here that you use a lot, so you can update your boilerplate to adapt to<br>your
			workflow.
