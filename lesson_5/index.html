					October is finally here, which means the spooky season is in full swing. From planning a marathon of the
					best Halloween movies to assembling the perfect costume (or couple's costume for a dynamic duo),
					anticipation for the Halloween holiday occupies most of the month.
				</p>
				<p>
					But what is Halloween? In America, the highly commercialized celebration brings to mind trick-or-treating
					and fun gatherings filled with Halloween party games and spooky treats, but the holiday has some
					convoluted
					origins to say the least. Is Halloween a religious holiday? Or a secular one? Is it Christian? Or pagan?
					The
					answer can be yes, yes, yes, and yes—and largely depends on your beliefs and how you celebrate.
				</p>
				<p>
					So let's cut through the confusion by revisiting the history of Halloween and the origins of some of its
					most beloved traditions.
				</p>

					What is the meaning of Halloween?
				</h3>
				<p>
					The current English name Halloween traces back to medieval Christianity. The word hallow is derived from
					the Middle and Old English words for holy. As a noun, it can also mean saint. In those days, the
					Christian holiday we know as All Saints' Day was called All Hallows' Day, and the day before, when an
					evening mass was held, was All Hallows' Eve. That name eventually got shortened to Halloween.

				<h3 class="Why is Halloween celebrated on October 31?">
					What is the meaning of Halloween?
				</h3>
				<p>
					There are two answers to this question: a pagan one and a Christian one.
				</p>
				<p>
					The ancient Gaelic festival of Samhain, which occurred on November 1 but kicked off the evening before,
					is considered the earliest known root of our secular Halloween traditions. It marked a pivotal time of
					year when seasons changed, but more importantly, observers also believed the boundary between this world
					and the next became especially thin, enabling them to connect with the dead. This is also where the
					history of Halloween gains its "haunted" connotations.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the etymology of the name suggests, Halloween has Christian roots too. Celebrations of Christian
					martyrs and saints date back to 4th-century Rome. In the early 7th century, Pope Boniface IV put All
					Saints' Day on the calendar when he dedicated the Pantheon in Rome to the saints, but the day was May 13.
					In the next century, Pope Gregory III changed the day to November 1 when he dedicated a chapel in St.
					Peter’s Basilica to the saints. Yet another century later, Pope Gregory IV added All Saints' Day to the
					universal Christian calendar, officially extending the celebration from Rome to churches everywhere.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the Christian celebration of All Saints' Day on November 1 came All Hallows' Eve, or Halloween, on
					October 31, as well as All Souls' Day on November 2—a three-day holiday collectively called Hallowtide.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="thirdchapter">
				<h3 class="hallowentitle">
					Is Halloween a pagan holiday or Christian holiday?
				</h3>
				<p>
					Though largely a secular celebration today, Halloween has both Christian and pagan roots.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the Middle Ages, as the Christian Roman holiday of All Saints' Day spread to other Christianized
					areas, Hallowtide traditions merged with local cultures. In Celtic regions that formerly celebrated
					Sahmain around the same time, the local Christian Halloween traditions that arose included
					jack-o-lanterns, bonfires, and costumes.
				</p>
				<p>
					Did these local Christian Halloween customs evolve from older pagan traditions? Most scholars agree that
					they did, though Catholic sources dispute the notion as lacking historic evidence.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the heart of the controversy is the fact that the ancient Celts did not leave written records, though
					we do have artifacts, such as a 1st-century B.C.E. bronze calendar found in France that references
					Sahmain. Folklore studies provide context about Sahmain too, but for the layperson who, as scholar
					Carolyn Emerick puts it, "does not sit around reading folklore journals from the 1800s," it can be
					difficult to wrap your head around.
				</p>
				<p>
					Writing about the origin of the jack-o-lantern, Emerick explains, "We arrive at this conclusion not by
					hard evidence like a written record because the inhabitants of Britain did not record things in writing
					during the pre-Christian era. We assume the pagan origins of folk customs like the jack-o'-lantern by
					analyzing them within the context and framework in which they are presented in the folklore and the
					larger folk culture."

					The history of Halloween traditions
				</h3>
				<p>
					The early pagan holiday of Samhain involved a lot of ritualistic ceremonies to connect to spirits, as the
					Celts were polytheistic. While there isn't a lot of detail known about these celebrations, many believe
					the Celts celebrated in costume (granted, they were likely as simple as animal hides) as a disguise
					against ghosts, lit jack-o-lanterns, and enjoyed special feasts.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over time, as Christianity took over and the pagan undertones of the holiday were lessened.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Irish custom of lighting jack-o-lanterns to ward away evil spirits came to have a Christian-themed
					allegory attached to it: A character named Stingy Jack outsmarts the Devil and avoids Hell, but his
					sinful dealings keep his soul out of Heaven. Instead, his soul roams the Earth, lighting his path with an
					ember held in a carved radish.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other mystical rituals of earlier times evolved into more lighthearted fun and games. For example, the
					somewhat heavy concept of connecting to the dead was replaced with the more lighthearted idea of telling
					the future. Bobbing for apples, for example, became popular as a fortune-telling game on All Hallows'
					Eve: Apples would be selected to represent all of a woman's suitors, and the guy—er, apple—she ended up
					biting into would supposedly represent her future husband. In fact, Halloween previously posed a huge
					(albeit rather superstitious) matchmaking opportunity for young women in the 19th century.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another popular All Hallows' Eve ritual was mirror-gazing, as people hoped to catch a vision of their
					future by looking into the mirror. There are also reports of fortune-cookie-like favors being given out
					during earlier times. People wrote messages on pieces of paper in milk, and the notes were then folded
					and placed into walnut shells. The shells would be heated over a fire, causing the milk to brown just
					enough for the message to mystically appear on the paper for the recipient.

				<h3 class="hallowentitle">
					The history of Halloween costumes and trick-or-treating
				</h3>
				<p>
					An early precursor to trick-or-treating is believed to be "souling," the tradition of going door to door
					asking for "soul cakes," a treat similar to biscuits, in exchange for prayers for the dead in purgatory.
					(Technical note: Soul cakes originated as part of the All Souls' Day holiday on November 2.) The
					tradition also involved dressing up, as we see in one recollection of souling in England, published in
					1886, that describes children in "fantastic costume."
				</p>
				<p>
					The Scottish practice of guising, a secularized version of souling, swapped the prayers for tricks. The
					costumes evolved too, taking a scary turn when young Scottish and Irish pranksters got the idea to spook
					unsuspecting neighbors.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eventually, this evolved into the tradition of trick-or-treating in the United States. The candy-grabbing
					concept became mainstream in the early to mid-1900s, during which families would provide treats to
					children in hopes that they would be immune to any holiday pranks.
				</p>

				<h3 class="hallowentitle">
					How Halloween came to America
				</h3>
				<p>
					The Halloween holiday remains a popular in America today, but it actually almost didn't make it across
					the Atlantic. The Puritans were disapproving of the holiday's pagan roots, so they didn't take part. The
					American colonial Halloween celebrations that did take place featured large public parties to commemorate
					the upcoming harvest, tell ghost stories, sing, and dance.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was not until the second half of the 19th century as Irish and Scottish immigrants began to arrive in
					America in greater numbers that the holiday took hold as part of the national zeitgeist. It's estimated
					that by the early 20th century, Halloween was celebrated across North America by the majority of
					(candy-loving, costume-wearing) people.
				</p>
				<div class="foto">
					<img src="img/products/foto4.png" alt="witch on a broomstick">
				</div>
				<p>
					Today, our Halloween holiday traditions continue to evolve. Instead of trick-or-treating house to house,
					some deck out their vehicles in spooky tailgate fashion for community trunk-or-treats, which are often
					held in school or church parking lots. In 2019, a popular movement to move the date of Halloween led to
					the creation of National Trick-or-Treat Day on the last Saturday of October. However, Halloween remains
					on October 31, and how communities celebrate the new National Trick-or-Treat Day, if at all, depends on
					local organizers.
				</p>
				<p>
					This year, once again, we'll all be enjoying our favorite candy and admiring our neighbors' decorations
					on October 31—and the only spooky spirits we'll be talking about are the witch and ghost costumes our
					friends are wearing.
